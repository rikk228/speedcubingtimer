You'll find a table with the result, and the attempt number. You can sort the attempt by the time taken or the attempt number. <br>You can even delete certain attempts, or view more info by clicking the relative icons. </p><h3>What are the rules?</h3> <p>We provide you with only the relevant rules from WCA, on <a class="link" href="/rules/">this page</a> you can find all the rules and regulations.</p><h3>What are the meaning of those letters?</h3> <p>If you are new to speedcubing, you probably wondering what letters like: "L, R, U.." and more means. Those are abbreviations of the moves. For instance, the L means a turn clockwise on the left of 90 degrees. Same with U, and R.
